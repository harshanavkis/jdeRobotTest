# Solutions for the Python Challenge

## Descriptions of the files:

* main.py : user interface to the application
* myConway.py : contains the Grid class used to implement Conway's Game of Life
* test_myConway.py : contains unittests for the functions of the Grid class

## Requirements:

* Python version = 3.6.0
* Only standard libraries used

## Usage:

To start the application (GUI interface):

```
python main.py -width wval -height hval
```

* wval represents the grid width in terms of the number of cells
* hval represents the grid height in terms of the number of cells

* The user can choose any random pattern to start the game or can enter his or her pattern by choosing the relevant cells
